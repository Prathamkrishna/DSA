# Data Structures and Algorithmic code for C++ and Java.

If using this repository, do install minGW to run c++ code on your system and install the JRE to run the java code.

**Note that Linux comes installed with minGW/C++ compiler**

The commands to run C++ code:

-> Move into the desired directory containing the C++ file.

-> Every operating system has a different terminal line of code to execute the C++ program:
   - For Linux systems, first compile the code with the '**g++ _filename_**' and then execute the code using '**./a.out**'.
   - For other operating systems, compile the code using '**g++ -o _anyname_ _filename_**' and then execute the code using '**./anyname**'.

The commands to run the Java code: 

-> Move into the desired directory containing the Java file.

-> Compile the Java code using '**javac _filename_**'.

-> Run the Java code using '**java _filename(without '.java' extension)_**'.
